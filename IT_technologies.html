		<h2>IT Technologies: Autonomous vehicles</h2>

    <p>Autonomous vehicles- regardless of type- car, truck, train etc- are
    vehicles able to reduce reliance on a human driver for their operation,
    either in part or in full. The reduction in human operation relates to the
    degree or scale of autonomy achieved in the vehicle itself and depending on
    the vehicle type, there are different scales that apply. The Society of
    Automotive Engineers has developed an industry wide scale (SAE J3016) that
    applies for on-road vehicles such as cars (Aptiv, 2020). While only level 4
    and 5 vehicles are considered to be actual driverless vehicles, the scale
    ranges from level 0 (no automation) to level 5 (full automation) with a
    breakdown provided below;</p>

    <img src= "levels_of_automation.PNG" alt="levels of automation">
	  <p>(Source: NHTSA)</p>

    <p><b>Level 0 (no automation) –</b> driver is fully responsible for the operation
    of the vehicle. Features such as electronic stability control, ABS braking
    and warning systems like parking sensors etc are not counted towards driving
    automation as they are only momentary aids that do not eliminate the role of
    the driver in the driving task.</p>

    <p><b>Level 1 (basic driver assistance) –</b> some automation of function but
    generally limited and only in specific circumstances, eg: automation of
    acceleration for adaptive cruise control</p>

    <p><b>Level 2 (partial automation) –</b> vehicles can partially automate functions
    such as acceleration, braking and steering in certain circumstances via
    advanced driver assistance systems however the driver must always be
    prepared to take control of the vehicle.</p>

    <p><b>Level 3 (conditional automation) –</b> the driver can disengage from
    the act of driving and the vehicle is capable of automated driving however
    generally only in certain circumstances and conditions (eg: high congestion,
    low speed driving). The driver still needs to be able to resume control of
    the vehicle when required and the vehicle must be able to monitor the state
    of the driver to ensure that they are capable of taking control- the vehicle
    must be able to come to a safe stop if the driver does not resume
    control.</p>

    <p><b>Level 4 (high automation) –</b> the vehicle is fully capable of performing
    all driving tasks within the scope of its operational driving domain (ODD).
    The system must be able to monitor for conditions or hazards outside of its
    ODD and, depending on the vehicle operation, the driver may need to resume
    operation if advised by the system and the system must be able to bring the
    vehicle to a safe stop if the driver does not respond.
    The ODD is defined as “Operating conditions under which a given driving
    automation system or feature thereof is specifically designed to function,
    including, but not limited to, environmental, geographical, and time-of-day
    restrictions, and/or the requisite presence or absence of certain traffic or
    roadway characteristics”  (Lance Eliot, 2019).</p>

    <p><b>Level 5 (full automation) –</b> no driver is required for any functions and
    the vehicle is capable of fully automated function in any location and
    under any circumstance (that a human driver could operate in). Depending on
    design, vehicles may not have a steering wheel or pedals etc. Passengers
    would have control of and be able to input destination data, adjust internal
    temperature / climate control functions and play music etc  (Aptiv, 2020).</p>

    <p>Currently, Level 2 and level 3 vehicles are available for purchase. There
    are many trials of level 4 vehicles occurring and publicly accessible
    “robo-taxi” services are currently in limited operation  (Timothy Lee, 2020)
    and trial operation  (Takashi Kawakami, 2021) in different locations and by
    different companies. Level 5 vehicles are not yet available for purchase by
    the public.</p>

    <p>While level 4 vehicle usage is likely to become more widespread it is
    unlikely that level 5 vehicles will be possible in the near-term future; the
    difficulty moving from level 4 to level 5 has been described as “orders of
    magnitude harder than transitions between other levels” (Hussein Dia, 2021, para 13)
    and aside from the technological improvements
    needed (such as cheaper sensors and better artificial intelligence),
    regulatory hurdles and public acceptance of automated vehicle technology
    still remain problems to be overcome (John McDermid, 2020).</p>

    <p>Autonomous vehicles require onboard computers, specially designed
    self-driving software, control systems and sensors (such as lidar, radar,
    cameras, odometers, GPS etc). Each higher level of automation generally
    requires additional sensors and better software as more functions become
    automated. Processes such as machine learning can be useful to improve
    automated driving performance over time and technologies such as artificial
    intelligence and neural networks can and will be used to further improve
    the learning process (Hussein Dia, 2021).</p>

    <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>

    <p>Autonomous vehicles are predicted to have impacts across a number of
    industries and facets of society, so a brief look at one positive and one
    negative aspect will be explored below;</p>

    <p>According to Road Safety Education Victoria, “human factors” are involved
    in up to 95% of road crashes (as either the sole factor or in combination
    with other factors)  (Road Safety Education Victoria, 2021). In this
    context, “human factors” are described as “the behaviour of the people
    involved – such as: deliberate risk taking; distraction (mobile phones,
    music, friends); tiredness (resulting in poor concentration); driving while
    affected by alcohol or drugs; lateness (resulting in speeding); disregard for
    road rules; choosing the unsafe option (such as a pedestrian crossing between
    moving vehicles)”  (Road Safety Education Victoria, 2021). So, factoring in
    fewer human drivers, the most positive likely impact of increased usage of
    autonomous vehicles is predicted to be a reduction in accidents and the
    subsequent injuries and deaths associated with them. </p>

    <p>A report by the Australian Automobile Association found that in 2015,
    the following costs were attributed to road trauma
    (Australian Automobile Association, 2017);</p>

    <ul>
    <li>the total cost of road trauma was $22.2 billion</li>
    <li>the (economic) cost of fatalities was $4.34 million (per fatality)</li>
    <li>the cost per hospitalisation caused by road injury was $239,000</li>
    <li>the direct cost to government– as distinct from the total economic
    cost – was more than $3.7 billion</li>
    </ul>

    <p>From a non-economics perspective, some more recent data from the
    Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and
    Communication
    (Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics, 2021) indicates;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>during the 12 months ending July 2021, there were 1,148 road deaths</li>
    <li>in 2018-19, there were 39,755 people admitted to hospital with road crash injuries</li>
    <li>average annual hospitalisations from road crashes for a three year period
    (ending 2018-2019) were 39,455</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Fewer road accidents would likely then have many economic benefits
    associated with increased societal productivity and reduced costs associated
    to healthcare and provisioning disability care, and lost taxation revenue etc
    and- from a more human perspective- reduce the number of deaths, injuries
    and permanent disabilities suffered each year.</p>

    <p>On the other side, another direct impact would be on employment in
    driving and transport related industries. With “robo-taxi” services already
    in (limited) operation, taxi drivers are clearly likely to be impacted as
    their industry becomes progressively more automated, the same going for
    train and truck drivers. And while it is difficult to determine the full
    impact these changes will have or the timeframe for which these impacts
    will occur, there is likely to be (overall) negative impacts on employment
    in affected industries. In Australia in 2015, more than 247,000 people were
    employed driving buses, taxis, trains and trucks. (Australian Parliament
    House, 2017)</p>

    <p>In a report by the Australian Parliament, research from the ARC Robotic
    Futures Research Team was noted; “In the domain of land-based transportation,
    the advent of driverless vehicles is likely to change the labour skills
    required... Rather than entirely unmanned vehicles, research on automation
    indicates that the role of the driver is likely to change from vehicle
    control, to monitoring… Many predict that the consequences for the current
    transportation labour force are likely to be negative... Predictions are
    for fewer workers, with one operative potentially overseeing multiple
    vehicles.” (Australian Parliament House, 2017)</p>

    <h3>How will this affect me?</h3>

    <p>There are a few ways that I (as an individual who doesn’t drive) can
    stand to benefit from automated vehicles. Firstly, as dedicated user of
    public transport I, personally, would likely have better access to buses
    and trains, with each transport method predicted to be more punctual as
    well as potentially running more services, especially outside of peak
    times.</p>

    <p>Due to reductions in operating costs, bus services could potentially be
    delivered more frequently and with greater flexibility in more areas
    (Neema Nassir, 2019).</p>

    <p>According to Siemens Mass Transit general manager Frank Gerken, for
    systems with automatic train operation "Train operations become more exact
    and timely as the automation system controls the trains according to a
    schedule split in seconds... The frequency of the trains can be enhanced,
    especially in low traffic hours, as more and shorter trains can be inserted
    in traffic..." (Railway Technology, 2011, para 14).</p>

    <p>Depending on the economics and uptake, robo-taxi services will likely be
    cheaper (Graham Rapier, 2019) and more readily available than current taxi
    services, offering an additional (and more price-comparable) choice of
    travel.</p>

    <p>If, as some anticipate  (Veronica Combs, 2019), automated vehicles
    reduce the rate of car ownership, then there may be fewer cars on the road.
    This would make cities more pedestrian friendly and potentially help to
    reduce the number of accidents involving pedestrians and road vehicles.</p>

    <p>In general day to day life, I would expect to spend less time waiting for
    public transport services, have cheaper access to taxis and experience
    greater user satisfaction with both of those services- these benefits would
    be shared by many of my friends and family, however they will be
    predominantly benefit those who live in urban and suburban environments or
    areas with a greater range of public transport access (as rural areas
    typically have poor access to public transport and, thus, low rates of
    public transport usage and higher rates of vehicle ownership).</p>
