    <h1>Intro to IT: Team Unsure - Assignment 2</h1>
		<h2>IT Project</h2>
		<h2> Project Overview</h2>
		<p>
			Our project is based on an application or a website which is used for recruiting purposes, 
			mostly for students. This site will cover various parts of the recruitment sectors including 
			applicant or employee profiles, job advertisements in the area of the applicant as well as 
			having mini courses to direct the employee in regards to the type of knowledge they need to 
			have before applying for or entering a particular workplace. For example, if there was a job 
			position available at a liquor handling store, the applicant will have access to a mini 
			assessment / course module, which would give them an adequate amount of information, 
			training as well as a certification, declaring them fit for the role.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Motivation</h2>
		<p>
			Our main motivation behind this project is because it is so relatable to our current life as a uni student. 
			We strongly believe every student should have a part time job along with their studies so they get experience
			 and exposure from a professional workplace before they try and pursue the career of their post graduation. 
			 However, we also know the difficulties one could face when trying to apply for the job. Sometimes after 
			 applying for a job, one might not hear from the employer ever again in regards to the application or 
			 sometimes even if they are notified about their application, it is not the news which they were hoping for. 
			 We believe there should be a platform where students from high school and universities are given more than 
			 just a job title to find out what their role would consist of in order to prepare themselves better for their employment.
		</p>
		
		<h2> Project Description</h2>
		<h3>Layout</h3>
		<p> The layout of the site would be similar to a recruiting website’s layout. Meaning, this would contain the following basic features;
		  <p> > A toolbar at the top of the page where job types can be searched by keywords.</p>
		  <p> > Applicants can enter what location they are after as well as choosing a certain radius to the location entered.</p> 
		  <p> > Type of employment they are after, that being part time, casual, fixed term or full time.</p> 
		  <p> > Classification of the workplace. This can be chosen from a drop down menu which would basically contain all the jobs available in each respective sector. Some options from the drop down menu can include education, hospitality, sales, trades & services, etc.</p> 
		  <p> > There wouldn’t be an option to select the desired remuneration rate as this site is mostly targeted towards students and a large percentage of such jobs do not show the hourly rate on an advertisement, as it is usually discussed in an interview or induction. </p> 
		</p>
		
		<h2>Job advertisement example</h2>
		<i> Team Member at Dan Murphy's Caroline Springs</i>
		<p><b>Specific Requirments for the role;</b></p>
		<p>> Over the age of 18</p>
		<p>> Responsible service of Alcohol check (RSA)</p>
		
		<p>Each applicant for the job must have a RSA as it is a legal document/training required by the Victorian Government. 
			The site will be able to guide the user to another page which will have exactly all the details required in order 
			to complete the RSA.
		</p>
		<P> Once the applicant has completed the RSA or any required course / certification (such as the working with children’s check) 
			all of their details will be linked to their account so it is easier for them to access all of their certificates 
			or work related documents such as resumes and cover letters, every time they are applying for a job.
		</P>
		<p>All employers will have similar questions in regards to one’s working rights or questions about their previous working experience. 
			All of these details will be pre-filled with the information provided by the user through their documents which they initially upload 
			to the site, so that this can improve the timeliness of the applications and be much more convenient for the user. 
		</p>
		<h2>Employer Page</h2>
		<p> Another feature which I would like to include in the site would be for the employers themselves. 
			All employers through their sign in page will have access to the applicant’s profiles. 
			This way, the process of hiring the correct employee can be streamlined, saving the business valuable time and money. 
		</p>
		<p> Successful applicants will receive a message from the site in regards to their application which will have further details 
			in regards to their interview and the next steps. 
		</p>
		<p> Where does that leave the unsuccessful applicants? One common event across most recruitment firms is that the unsuccessful 
			applicants are left high and dry in regards to their application and are not sure of what is happening. 
			One of our main objectives is to make sure that the applicants are fully aware of each stage of the process. 
			This includes;
		</p>
		<p>> Notifying them when an application is submitted.</p>
		<p>> Application has been opened and read by the employer. </p>
		<p>> Notification message when either both successful or unsuccessful.</p>
		
		<h2>Tools and Skills required</h2>
		<p> As touched on initially, the website itself would likely be built in / with HTML and CSS code, 
			so proficiency in both HTML and CSS would be required.
			In addition, the website would likely require one or more databases, which would store the information for both
			 the job applicants and employers. A variety of free database programs are available such as MySQL, MicrosoftSQL, PostgreSQL, 
			 Mongo DB, CouchDB and DynamoDB however depending on the size and storage requirements a commercial (paid) database solution 
			 may be required. Querying data from the database (and updating the database with user information) would require 
			 a built database and knowledge of SQL to program the queries.
			Accessing the database and displaying the returned data on the website would likely require both knowledge of, 
			and programming skills in, a server-side scripting language such as PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, 
			or JavaScript (NodeJS) (MDN Web Docs, n.d). Programming would also be required for sending
			 communications / emails to the website users to confirm events like when their applications 
			 have been submitted and advise when are being reviewed by an employer or recruiter etc. 
			 Further website programming would be needed for managing user requests and interactions 
			 such as document management (uploading or deleting a CV or certification etc), managing 
			 the types of account communication / notifications sent received, updating account profiles 
			 and password reset requests. The website would also need to either link users to outside websites 
			 or have embedded information for education or certification requirements for the role being advertised.
			For a functional and live product, IT security would also need to be considered, due to the data 
			and documents etc being collected from applicants and employers. Protocols such as HTTPS 
			(Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)
			 would be required for the website and default website access privileges would need to be set for each type of user. 
			 Consideration would likely need to be given to using secure web hosting services who may incorporate firewalls, 
			 anti-virus, and possibly even more specialised website monitoring security software into their hosting services
			
		</p>
		
		<h2>Outcome</h2>
		<p> If the site is successfully launched then we  believe it can assist 
			a lot of people with their employment as well as firms with their recruitment. 
			People will have access to all the relevant jobs according to their needs and 
			if required will have the right accreditation for the role too. The process of 
			recruitment can be an arduous one for most businesses without a large recruiting budget. 
			The site should be able to successfully assist employers in choosing the right worker for 
			their firm by showing them all the relevant details about the applicants.
