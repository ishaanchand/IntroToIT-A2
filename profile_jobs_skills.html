      	<p>"I come from an English-speaking family of English & Australian ancestry. In my spare time, I enjoy computer gaming and gardening.
        I think my interest in IT was really piqued when cybersecurity started to become a
				more household term, due to an increased occurrence of cyber crime
				against both public and private organisations and an increasing number
				of large-scale cyber security events, such as the SolarWinds hack and
				the compromising of Microsoft Exchange email servers etc."</p>

	  <h3>Observations: similarities and differences</h3>

	  <img src="skill_matrix.PNG" alt="team skill matrix">

	  <p>There are a few general IT skills shared between members- cyber security (Julian, Nima, Ishaan), networking (Julian, Nima, Tommy) and system administration (Julian, Nima, Tommy), cloud computing (Ishaan and Sam) . As a universally needed skill, communication is required by all members in their roles while organisation skills are more necessary for those with direct client interaction and / or work-loads that are managed according to deadlines or milestone targets.</p>
	  <p>The group has 3 members (Julian, Nima and Ishaan) who have roles focused on cyber security (or elements thereof) however the roles themselves are quite different- Ishaan’s role would be more based on product knowledge and sales (offering cloud services and security and IT service management services to clients), while Julian’s and Nima’s roles are more hands on, as their roles would involve direct application of cyber security skills and knowledge. Tommy’s role is also of a more practical nature, building PCs, setting up networks and performing fault troubleshooting across a variety of domains (PC hardware and software, wifi networks and email).</p>
	  <p>Sam is the only member whose role will focus on programming and software engineering, though it shares the same need for strong organisational skills as Ishaan and Tommy’s.</p>
	  <p>Ishaan and Tommy will have direct interaction with their clients whereas Julian, Nima and Sam would likely have little outside client interaction. Ishaan’s clients are likely to be large businesses while Tommy’s are likely to be small businesses or individuals.</p>
	  <p>Having the most similar roles, Julian and Nima have the most similar required skill sets and career path plans, aiming to complete study and begin working to gain cyber security experience and attaining relevant cyber security certification. With that said, each member has expressed the need to gain working experience in their relevant fields in order to be successful in applying for their listed role.</p>
